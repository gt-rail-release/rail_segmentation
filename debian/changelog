ros-indigo-rail-segmentation (0.1.0-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * added RGB image to message
  * average RGB on marker
  * uses indices instead of new PCs
  * Merge pull request #1 from WPI-RAIL/refactor
    Refactor
  * merge conflicts
  * Revert "plane detection refactored"
    This reverts commit 7160b0b12e55755451ec5c8a9318e05552924cc6.
  * doc added
  * cleanup of old files
  * first pass of new segmentation node
  * plane detection refactored
  * Added a recognize all action which gives feedback throughout the recognition process; the recognize all server remains for compatibility, but it's recommended to use the action server instead.
  * Edited .travis.yml
  * Merge branch 'develop' of github.com:WPI-RAIL/rail_segmentation into develop
  * Updated to reflect moving some messages from rail_segmentation to rail_manipulation_messages
