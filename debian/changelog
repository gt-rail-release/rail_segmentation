ros-melodic-rail-segmentation (0.1.13-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Safer wait for point cloud that checks timestamps
  * Switched continuous point cloud polling for waitForMessage
  * Added an option to publish marker labels for each cluster for debugging
  * Added a flag to the segmentation zone config to require a table; if this is set to true, segmentation will only be performed if a surface was successfully detected in the current segmentation zone.
  * New service for re-calculating (or filling in uncalculated) features of segmented objects, assuming that at minimum the point cloud field is set
  * Exposed cluster tolerance as a parameter
  * Optional parameter for cropping the workspace before table detection (defaults to false so it won't change behavior for anything currently using rail_segmentation), which potentially speeds up segmentation but may cause table detection to fail more often when segmenting in small, cluttered segmentation zones

ros-melodic-rail-segmentation (0.1.11-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Segmenter.h: Fix compilation error with -std=c++11.
    This commit fixes compilation errors due to compilation with std=c++11,
    such as:
    include/rail_segmentation/Segmenter.h:82:23: error: ‘constexpr’ needed for
    in-class initialization of static data member
    ‘const double rail::segmentation::Segmenter::SAC_EPS_ANGLE’ of
    non-integral type [-fpermissive]
    static const double SAC_EPS_ANGLE = 0.15;
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Signed-off-by: Elvis Dowson <elvis.dowson@gmail.com>
  * Fixing a small bug so that the segment_objects service matches the topic data
  * Better bounding box calculation, added average rgb and cielab color to segmented object messages as they are calculated anyway, and added an alternative service api, segment_objects, that returns the segmented object list in the service response (while still broadcasting the segmented object list on the topic)
  * Constant definition fix for functions with reference parameters
  * Added option for euclidean + RGB clustering instead of solely euclidean distance
